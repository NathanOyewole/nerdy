# 🖤 The CringeCore Nerdverse

A dark, terminal-inspired personal webspace built with style, attitude, and raw aesthetic.  
**The CringeCore Nerdverse** is a custom-coded portal for the terminal-obsessed, anime-glitched, edge-core freaks who love retro, CLI vibes and want their portfolio or site to *feel like hacking into a dystopian database*.

## 🔧 What is this?

This is a static, responsive terminal-style website with sections that mimic CLI/TTY interfaces.  
It can be used as a:

- Developer landing page
- Terminal-themed portfolio
- Personal nerdy web hub
- Cyberpunk-ish digital garden
